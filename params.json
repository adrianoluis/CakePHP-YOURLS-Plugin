You can find an example of what you'll need and how it is laid out in `/Yourls/Config/yourls.php.example`.\r\n\r\n\t//app/Config/yourls.php\r\n\t$config = array(\r\n\t\t'Yourls' => array(\r\n\t\t\t'url' => 'YOURLS_URL',\r\n\t\t\t'username' => 'YOURLS_USERNAME',\r\n\t\t\t'password' => 'YOURLS_PASSWORD',\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nYou can call the component from any action in a controller or automate url shortening just using the follow code in your `/APP/Controller/AppController.php`:\r\n\r\n\tpublic function beforeRender() {\r\n\t\t$this->pageTitle = 'your url title goes here'\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nPS: is necessary to provide a title for shorter method otherwise it'll go in a infinite loop trying to resolve URL's title using YOURLS internal libs.\r\n\r\nThan from yout view, access the shorted url using:\r\n\r\n\t<?php echo $shorturl['url']; ?>\r\n\r\nTo get statistics from all your links you must change the default plugin format to xml (son is nor supported yet). This new setup changes the return from shorturl method.\r\n\r\n\tpublic $components = array(\r\n\t\t'Yourls.Yourls' => array(\r\n\t\t\t'format' => 'xml'\r\n\t\t)\r\n\t);\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
